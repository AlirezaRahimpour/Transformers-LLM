# Transformers-LLM
My reimplementations of some of the transformer-based models and their training and finetuning. 

- [x] [Pretraining the transformer decoder](/Transformer_decoder_GPT.py)
- [x] Llama2 finetuning using LoRA on single GPU on [samsum data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Samsung/samsum)
- [ ] Language + Vision Self-Supervised Learning
- [ ] Work in progress... :)
